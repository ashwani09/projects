        <h1>MATT CLARK MUSIC</h1>
        <h5>Fun, quirky music for the whole family.</h5>
        
        <p>
            Matt writes and performs kids' music in Portland where he's become a favourite on the blossoming
            Kindle music scene. Children and parents alike love his funny, off beat songs, inspired by his
            Own experience as a father to two young boys.

        </p>
        
            
        <P>
            Matt's first album, "funny little fella" was listed as one of the best kids' music debuts of 2008 by
            about.com. His follow up album was hailed by Oregon music news as a step above his first - "more variety tighter song craft, great
            production yet still the same gentle, loving sentiments and
            approach to kids."

        </P>
